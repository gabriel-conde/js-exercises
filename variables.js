// What answers would I get if I ran these inputs in the
// Javascript Console in Google Chrome.


// I added variable "firstName" and "lastName" // so that they equal my name
var firstName = "Gabriel";
var lastName = "Conde";
// I created a variable that holds the answer // of "firstName" + " " + "lastName"
var fullName = (firstName) + " " + (lastName);
console.log(fullName);
// What is a + b?
var a = 34;
var b = 21;
a = 2;
a + b // a + b = 23 since a was reassigned the value of '2'

// What is c equal to?
var c; // c = undefined since it has no value assigned
